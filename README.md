# Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) Examples

This repository contains Question-Answering (QA) and Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) examples.

Each example/subproject is independent; specific sources, necessary packages, setup & Co. are explained inside each subproject folder.

- [`qa-finetuning/`](./qa-finetuning/): an LLM is fine-tuned to accomplish extractive QA tasks on a new dataset.
- [`qa-rag/`](./qa-rag/): a basic system of Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) is implemented to showcase how to build a chatbot which dynamically answers questions of new datasets.
- [`advanced-rag-langchain/`](./advanced-rag-langchain/): notes and examples from the official LangChain course [RAG from Scratch](https://github.com/langchain-ai/rag-from-scratch).
- [`local-rag/`](./local-rag/): a local Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) application, packaged and deployable.
- [`azure-rag/`](./azure-rag/): a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) application which uses Azure services and deployed on the same cloud provider.
