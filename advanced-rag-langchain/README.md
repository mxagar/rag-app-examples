## Advanced RAG Patterns Using Langchain

**I moved the project to**

**[mxagar/generative_ai_udacity/06_RAGs_DeepDive/01_RAG_from_Scratch](https://github.com/mxagar/generative_ai_udacity/tree/main/06_RAGs_DeepDive/01_RAG_from_Scratch)**

The project includes resources from [RAG from Scratch](https://github.com/langchain-ai/rag-from-scratch) as a submodule. The original author of that repository is Lance Martin, from Langchain.
